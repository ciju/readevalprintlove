One day the macrolyte approached the master macrologist
Pi Mu (Πム) and put forth a question:

> Master, which Lisp is the greatest of all Lisps?

Pi Mu looked at the macrolyte and, in a low tone, told him 
to meet him in the garden after the day's work was done and he would tell him the answer.

After a long day's toil[^toil] the macrolyte did as Pi Mu instructed 
and met him at the entryway to the humble garden.  He 
immediately posed his question again:

> Master, which Lisp is the greatest of all Lisps?

In a careful manner Pi Mu then pointed at a patch of nearby sakura and said:

> Look here at this patch of sakura.
>
> What a tall one that one.
>
> What a short one that one.

The student was at once enlightened.

[^toil]: Not nearly as rigorous as Pi Mu's however.

The theme of this installment of Read-Eval-Print-λove is: musings on the function, nature, differences and commonalities of the Lisp family of languages in general.
