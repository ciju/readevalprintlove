<p>I'm working through the first issue of Read-Eval-Print-λove and am basically done, but have a bit more research to do around Common Lisp's macrolet (I have the first 6 installments outlined also). However, the first thing I can say about it and future issues is that it will not focus strictly on any particular member of the Lisp family. Additionally, I will at times (once per issue most likely) cover other languages in the Little-language category. What does that mean? I don't know yet, but again, that's not the primary focus.</p>

<p>Every issue of Read-Eval-Print-λove will be made available through this site and mailing list for FREE, but I'm also exploring optional payment offerings through <a href="https://leanpub.com/readevalprintlove001">LeanPub</a>. This payment option would be "pay what you wish, with a small minimum" and is intended to offer alternate formats and updates only (i.e. epub, mobi, PDF). The content on this site/list and on Leanpub will be exactly the same.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy. :F</p>
